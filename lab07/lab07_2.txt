CS 344, Lab 7, Exercise 2
Elizabeth Koning

a. Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data
Categorical data is information like words or labels that divide the examples into different groups. Numerical data is a information that you want to treat as numbers. It makes sense to average numerical data, but not categorical data, even if the categories are numbers.

b. Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training output.

c. What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them?
