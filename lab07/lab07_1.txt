a.
Pandas exercise 1
cities['saint and large'] = (cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San'))) & (cities['Area square miles'] > 50)
cities

Pandas exercise 2
cities.reindex([3, 0, 5, 1, 4])
cities

b. Why would one use Pandas rather than the standard data manipulation features provided by NumPy?
The data manipulation features provided by Pandas can be helpful, and they are not available in NumPy. In a situation where one wants to use the features of Pandas, like the vectorized operations, reindexing, or adding columns, it is more practical to use Pandas.

c. Under what circumstances would it be useful to reorder/shuffle a Pandas DataFrame?
Shuffling a Pandas DataFrame could be particularly helpful if you need to separate your data into train and test segments. If you shuffle the DataFrame, then you can just take the first x as training data and the last y as testing data. This is an easy way to divide it randomly.
