Exercise 6.1
a. Framing
1. We want our machine learned model to classify emails as important or unimportant.

2. Our ideal outcome is to mark emails that the Gmail user finds to be worth time, attention, and/or action.

3.
Our success metrics are:
 - read rate
 - time spent interacting with email (includes responding as well as other interactions)
 - time until action/read

Our key results (KR) for the success metrics are:
 - Our system marks 70% of the emails the user reads as important
 - Our system marks 90% of the emails that the user performs a significant action with as important (lengthy response, clicking link, downloading attachment)
 - Users interact with/respond to important emails before the unimportant emails

Our ML model is deemed a failure if:
 - Emails marked as important are read/interacted with at the same rate as emails not marked as important

4.

The output from our ML model will be an indication of how important an email is.

The output is defined as a probability of whether the user interacts with/responds to the email.
