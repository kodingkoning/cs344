# Exercise 6.2

Information gain provided by the "Hungry?" question
$$
\begin{aligned}
Gain(Hungry?) &= Entropy(WillWait) - Remainder(Hungry?) \\
Entropy(WillWait) &= - \sum_{i=1}^{n}{v_i \cdot \log_2(v_i)} = - (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \log_2(\frac{1}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \log_2(\frac{1}{2})) = 1 \\
Remainder(Hungry?) &= \sum_{i=1}^{d}{p+n} \cdot Entropy(p_i / (p_i + n_i), n_i / (p_i + n_i)) \\ &= \frac{7}{12} \cdot Entropy(Hungry) + \frac{5}{12} \cdot Entropy(not Hungry) \\ &= \frac{7}{12} \cdot -(\frac{5}{7} \cdot \log_2(\frac{5}{7}) + \frac{2}{7} \cdot \log_2(\frac{2}{7})) + \frac{5}{12} \cdot -(\frac{1}{5} \cdot \log_2(\frac{1}{5}) + \frac{4}{5} \cdot \log_2(\frac{4}{5})) \\ &= 0.8043 \\
Gain(Hungry?) &= 1 - 0.8043 = 0.1957 bits
\end{aligned}
$$
Information gain from "Patrons?" is 0.54 bits, as calculated in class

Information gain from "Type?" is 0.0 bits, as calculated in class

By gaining 0.1957 bits of infromation from "Hungry?", we gain more information than from "Type?", but less than from "Patrons?" so we should still choose "Patrons?" above "Hungry?"
